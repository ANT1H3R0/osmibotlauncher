# Osmibot
_Launcher for version 2 of the greatest discord bot of all time_

Osmibot is a work-in-progress text bot for discord, written in python, created with the intention to fill one's every need.
Ideally, while using Osmibot, no other bots will be necessary for the function of the server.
Upon completion, Osmibot will feature:
1. Moderation commands, including ban, kick, mute, tempban, and prune.
2. 'Fun' commands, such as hug and dice, as well as several games.
3. Music commands, for playing audio from both online and remote sources.
4. An economy system for interacting with members of the server,
5. and commands relating to several games, such as overwatch, DoTA, and LoL.

# The Launcher
The launcher can be used to easily create an instance of Osmibot that is ready to run.
Its only prerequisites are Python 3.x and python-pip. All other dependencies can be installed using the launcher.
The latest stable release of the launcher can be downloaded in the releases section, and the current development build
is available above. 

After downloading and extracting the launcher, it can be run using the `launcher.bat` file on Windows or using the
command line on Linux or MacOS. First, run option __4__ or __3__ to install dependencies for the bot and then __6__
to download the bot. Afterwards, run option __5__ and enter your bot's token and client secret. 
Option __1__ (or on Windows, __2__) cam then be used to launch the bot.

# Currently Implemented Features
The following features are currently availble to the bot:
1. A fully fleshed out launcher that can be used to easily set up the bot.
2. .ping and .die commands to test the function of the bot and to safely shut it down.
